To compile and run an xdr program (such as vector)

1.  Get a copy of the programs generated by the programmer
    vector.x, 
    vector_client.c, vector_cif.c,
    vector_services.c, vector_sif.c

2.  Get the number assigned to your rpc program (first get a copy of Uniq_Id.c).
   > cc Uniq_Id.c -o Uniq_Id
   > Unique_Id

3.  Change the program number in vector.x to your program id

4.  Use rpcgen to automatically generate the .h, clnt, svc and xdr files.
 > rpcgen vector.x

5.  compile the client on the client machine
 > bcc vector_client.c vector_clnt.c vector_cif.c vector_xdr.c -o client.out
    Note: some programs will not need xdr routines so no vector_xdr.c
    file will be generated and it should be eliminated from the above list.
    Since our example here used only strings, specific xdr's were not necessary.

6.  compile the server on the server machine
 > bcc vector_services.c vector_svc.c vector_sif.c vector_xdr.c -o server.out
    Note: again you must include vector_xdr.c if Rpcgen creates it.

7.  run the server on the server machine
 > server.out

8.  run the client on the client machine
 > client.out

Notes: with cheetah you must add the option  -l rpclib in order to
access the library containing client create.
