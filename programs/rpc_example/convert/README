To compile and run an xdr program (such as convert)

1.  Get a copy of the programs generated by the programmer
    convert.x, 
    convert_client.c, convert_cif.c,
    convert_services.c, convert_sif.c

2.  Get the number assigned to your rpc program (first get a copy of Uniq_Id.c).
   > cc Uniq_Id.c -o Uniq_Id
   > Unique_Id

3.  Change the program number in convert.x to your program id

4.  Use rpcgen to automatically generate the .h, clnt, svc and xdr files.
 > rpcgen convert.x

5.  compile the client on the client machine
 > cc convert_client.c convert_clnt.c convert_cif.c -o client.out
    Note: in most programs you will need to include the xdr routines in
    the above list. Rpcgen will put these in a file called convert_xdr.c,
    just include that name in the cc list.
    Since our example here used only strings, specific xdr's were not necessary.

6.  compile the server on the server machine
 > cc convert_services.c convert_svc.c convert_sif.c -o server.out
    Note: again you must include convert_xdr.c if Rpcgen creates it.

7.  run the server on the server machine
 > server.out

8.  run the client on the client machine
 > client.out

Notes: on cheetah you must add the option -l rpclib to the compile
command to access the client create call.
